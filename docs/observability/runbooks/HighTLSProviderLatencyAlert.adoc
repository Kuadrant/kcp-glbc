= HighTLSProviderLatencyAlert

toc::[]

== Description

The source of the alert is the `glbc_tls_certificate_*` metric. It fires when there is high latency rate on the requests made.
The alert will be triggered if requests are taking longer than 0.5 seconds. This usually means, the TLS certificate provider is not responding, metrics is misconfigured, or the metrics endpoint is not responding.

== Prerequisites

// Include the following steps in every alert SOP
* Access to the physical cluster where GLBC should be running
