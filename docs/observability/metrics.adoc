## Generating metrics docs

To generate metrics docs, you need to have a running controller locally.
You should also create the sample echo-service so that all metrics get initialised.
Note that some metrics may take a couple minutes to get initial values e.g. `glbc_tls_certificate_issuance_duration_seconds_bucket`

Then run:

```
make gen-metrics-docs
```

There is a known issue with `process_` metrics missing on macos.
This is a limitation of the prometheus client and how process data is gathered on macos.
If you want to regenerate metrics docs on macos, you have 2 options.

### 1. Slightly risky, but easy option

Run the make target to pick up any new metrics changes. Then manually undo the removal of the `process_` metrics from the generated file.
As this is manual, it could be prone to a mistake, or there could be new process metrics added that you don't become aware of.
In either of those cases, the e2e PR test job should detect this and fail when running the `verify-gen-metrics-docs` target.

### 2. Safe, but complex option

First, run the controller in your local cluster by following the output at the end of `make local-setup`.

Then, build & configure the controller to run your local code:

```bash
# Build a local image
IMAGE_TAG=local make docker-build

# Load the image into the kind cluster where glbc is running
kind load docker-image quay.io/kuadrant/kcp-glbc:local --name kcp-cluster-glbc-control

# Patch the deployment in kcp so it doesn't try pull the image and also uses the loaded image
KUBECONFIG=./.kcp/admin.kubeconfig kubectl -n kcp-glbc patch deployment kcp-glbc-controller-manager --type json -p='[{"op":"replace","path":"/spec/template/spec/containers/0/image","value":"quay.io/kuadrant/kcp-glbc:local"},{"op":"replace","path":"/spec/template/spec/containers/0/imagePullPolicy","value":"Never"}]'
```

Next, set up port forwarding to the controller pod on port 8080 e.g. The pod name & namespace will be different each time.

```bash
kubectl port-forward kcp-glbc-controller-manager-5477dfdc8b-7xmwr 8080:8080 -n kcp89b5fd4ba9405ee7b18d0da859ce7420d36926bac4a97e01af5c244a
```

Finally, run the `make gen-metrics-docs` task.
